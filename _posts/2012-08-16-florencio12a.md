title: Learning Tree Adjoining Grammars from Structures and Strings
abstract: We investigate the learnability of certain subclasses of tree adjoining
  grammars (TAGs).  TAGs are based on two tree-tree operations, and generate structures
  known as \emphderived trees. The corresponding strings form a \emphmildly context-sensitive
  language. We prove that even very constrained subclasses of TAGs are not learnable
  from structures (derived trees) or strings, demonstrating that this type of problem
  is far from trivial. We also demonstrate that a large (parameterized) family of
  classes of TAGs is learnable from strings.
