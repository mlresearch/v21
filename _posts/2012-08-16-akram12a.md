title: Actively Learning Probabilistic Subsequential Transducers
abstract: In this paper we investigate learning of probabilistic subsequential   transducers
  in an active learning environment. In our learning   algorithm the learner interacts
  with an oracle by asking   probabilistic queries on the observed data. We prove
  our algorithm   in an identification in the limit model. We also provide   experimental
  evidence to show the correctness and to analyze the   learnability of the proposed
  algorithm.
