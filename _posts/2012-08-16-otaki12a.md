title: Estimation of Generating Processes of Strings Represented with Patterns and
  Refinements
abstract: We formalize generating processes of strings based on patterns and  substitutions,
  and give an algorithm to estimate a probability mass  function on substitutions,
  which is an element of processes.  Patterns are non-empty sequences of characters
  and variables.  Variables indicate unknown substrings and are replaced with other  patterns
  by substitutions.  By introducing variables and  substitutions, we can deal with
  the difficulty of preparing  production rules in generative grammar and of representing  context-sensitivity
  with them.  Our key idea is to regard sequences  of substitutions as generations
  of strings, and to give probabilities  of substitutions like PCFG.  In this study,
  after giving a problem to  estimate a probability mass function from strings based
  on our  formalization, we solve it by the Passing algorithm that runs in an  iterative
  manner.  Our experimental results with synthetic strings  show that our method estimates
  probability mass functions with  sufficient small errors.
