title: Clearing Restarting Automata and Grammatical Inference
abstract: Clearing and subword-clearing restarting automata are linguistically motivated
  models of automata. We investigate the problem of grammatical inference for such
  automata based on the given set of positive and negative samples.  We show that
  it is possible to identify these models in the limit. In this way we can learn a
  large class of languages. On the other hand, we prove that the task of finding a
  clearing restarting automaton consistent with a given set of positive and negative
  samples is NP-hard, provided that we impose an upper bound on the width of its instructions.
