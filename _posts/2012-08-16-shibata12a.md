title: Marginalizing Out Transition Probabilities for Several Subclasses of PFAs
abstract: 'A Bayesian manner which marginalizes transition probabilities can be generally
  applied to various kinds of probabilistic finite state machine models. Based on
  such a Bayesian manner, we implemented and compared three algorithms: variable-length
  gram, state merging method for PDFAs, and collapsed Gibbs sampling for PFAs. Among
  those, collapsed Gibbs sampling for PFAs performed the best on the data from the
  pre-competition stage of PAutomaC, although it consumes large computation resources.'
