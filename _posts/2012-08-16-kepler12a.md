title: Simple Variable Length N-grams for Probabilistic Automata Learning
abstract: This paper describes an approach used in the 2012 Probabilistic Automata
  Learning Competition. The main goal of the competition was to obtain insights about
  which techniques and approaches work best for sequence learning based on different
  kinds of automata generating machines. This paper proposes the usage of n-gram models
  with variable length.  Experiments show that, using the test sets provided by the
  competition, the variable-length approach works better than fixed 3-grams.
