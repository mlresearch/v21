title: Model Merging versus     Model Splitting Context-Free Grammar Induction
abstract: 'When comparing different grammatical inference algorithms, it becomes evident
  that generic techniques have been used in different systems.  Several finite-state
  learning algorithms use state-merging as their underlying technique and a collection
  of grammatical inference algorithms that aim to learn context-free grammars build
  on the concept of substitutability to identify potential grammar rules. When learning
  context-free grammars, there are essentially two approaches: model merging, which
  generalizes with more data, and model splitting, which specializes with more data.  Both
  approaches can be combined sequentially in a generic framework.  In this article,
  we investigate the impact of different approaches within the first phase of the
  framework on system performance.'
