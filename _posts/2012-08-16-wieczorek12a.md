title: Induction of Non-Deterministic Finite     Automata on Supercomputers
abstract: The problem of inducing automata of minimal size consistent with finite
  sets of examples and counter-examples is the combinatorial optimization task of
  grammatical inference and is known to be computationally hard.  Both an exact and
  a heuristic method of finding a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) with a
  given number of states such that all examples are accepted and all counter-examples
  are rejected by the automaton will be evaluated. The methods are based on a translation
  of NFA identification into integer nonlinear programming.
