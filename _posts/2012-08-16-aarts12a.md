title: Learning and Testing the Bounded Retransmission Protocol
abstract: Using a well-known industrial case study from the verification literature,
  the bounded retransmission protocol, we show how active learning can be used to
  establish the correctness of protocol implementation I relative to a given reference
  implementation R.  Using active learning, we learn a model M_R of reference implementation
  R, which serves as input for a model based testing tool that checks conformance
  of implementation I to M_R.  In addition, we also explore an alternative approach
  in which we learn a model M_I of implementation I, which is compared to model M_R
  using an equivalence checker.  Our work uses a unique combination of software tools
  for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based
  testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC).  We show how these tools
  can be used for learning these models, analyzing the obtained results, and improving
  the learning performance.
