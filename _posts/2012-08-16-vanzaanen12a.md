title: Learning Interpretations Using Sequence Classification
abstract: In this paper we present a system that assigns interpretations, in   the
  form of shallow semantic frame descriptions, to natural language   sentences.  The
  system searches for relevant patterns, consisting of   words from the sentences,
  to identify the correct semantic frame and   associated slot values.  For each of
  these choices, a separate   classifier is trained.  Each classifier learns the boundaries   between
  different languages, which each correspond to a particular   class.  The different
  classifiers each have their own viewpoint on   the data depending on which aspect
  needs to be identified.
