title: A Lattice of Sets of Alignments Built on the Common Subwords in a Finite Language
abstract: We define the locally maximal subwords and locally minimal superwords common
  to a finite set of words. We also define the corresponding sets of alignments. We
  give a partial order relation between such sets of alignments, as well as two operations
  between them. We show that the constructed family of sets of alignments has the
  lattice structure. We give hints to use this structure as a machine learning basis
  for inducing a generalization of the set of words.
