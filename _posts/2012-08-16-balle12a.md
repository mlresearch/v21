title: Bootstrapping and Learning PDFA in Data Streams
abstract: 'Markovian models with hidden state are widely-used formalisms for modeling
  sequential phenomena.  Learnability of these models has been well studied when the
  sample is given in batch mode, and algorithms with PAC-like learning guarantees
  exist for specific classes of models such as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite
  Automata (PDFA).  Here we focus on PDFA and give an algorithm for infering models
  in this class under the stringent \emphdata stream scenario: unlike existing methods,
  our algorithm works incrementally and in one pass, uses memory sublinear in the
  stream length, and processes input items in amortized constant time.  We provide
  rigorous PAC-like bounds for all of the above, as well as an evaluation on synthetic
  data showing that the algorithm performs well in practice.  Our algorithm makes
  a key usage of several old and new sketching techniques.  In particular, we develop
  a new sketch for implementing bootstrapping in a streaming setting which may be
  of independent interest.  In experiments we have observed that this sketch yields
  important reductions in the examples required for performing some crucial statistical
  tests in our algorithm.'
