title: Applying Grammar Inference To Identify Generalized Patterns of Facial Expressions
  of Pain
abstract: We present an application of grammar inference in the domain of facial expression
  analysis. Typically, only \emphsets of AUs which occur in a given time frame are
  used for expression analysis, the \emphsequence in which these AUs occur is ignored.
  We wanted to explore whether the strucural patterns of AU appearances contain diagnostically
  relevant information. We applied alignment-based learning (ABL) to data of facial
  expressions of pain collected in a psychological study.  To evaluate the quality
  of the induced grammars we applied cross-validation to estimate the generalization
  error. We can show that the learned grammars have reasonably high coverages for
  unseen pain sequences. However, the number of rules of the learned grammars cannot
  be reduced substantially without loss of generalization.
