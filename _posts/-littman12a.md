title: Inducing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
abstract: The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model plays an
  important role in the field of reinforcement learning.  It captures the problem
  of decision making when some important features of the environment are not visible
  to the decision maker.  A number of approaches have been proposed for inducing POMDP
  models from data, a problem that has important parallels with grammar induction.
