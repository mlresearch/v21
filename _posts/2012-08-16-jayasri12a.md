title: Learning of Bi-ω Languages from Factors
abstract: Higuera and Janodet (2001) gave a polynomial algorithm that identifies the
  class of safe ω-languages which is a subclass of deterministic ω-languages from
  positive and negative prefixes. As an extension of this work we study the learning
  of the family of bi-ω languages.
