title: Learning of Bi-$\omega$ Languages from Factors
abstract: Higuera and Janodet (2001) gave a polynomial algorithm that identifies the
  class of safe $\omega$-languages which is a subclass of deterministic $\omega$-languages from
  positive and negative prefixes. As an extension of this work we study the learning
  of the family of bi-$\omega$ languages.
