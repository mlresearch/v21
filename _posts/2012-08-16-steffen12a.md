title: 'Active Automata Learning: From DFAs to Interface Programs and Beyond'
abstract: 'This paper reviews the development of active learning in the last decade
  under the perspective of treating of data, a major source of undecidability, and
  therefore a key problem to achieve practicality. Starting with the first case studies,
  in which data was completely disregarded, we revisit different steps towards dealing
  with data explicitly in active learning: We discuss Mealy Machines as a model for
  systems with (data) output, automated alphabet abstraction refinement as a two-dimensional
  extension of the partition-refinement based approach of active learning for inferring
  not only states but also optimal alphabet abstractions, and Register Mealy Machines,
  which can be regarded as programs restricted to data-independent data processing
  as it is typical for protocols or interface programs. We are convinced that this
  development has the potential to transform active automata learning into a technology
  of high practical importance.'
