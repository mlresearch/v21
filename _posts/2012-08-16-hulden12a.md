title: 'Treba: Efficient Numerically Stable EM for PFA'
abstract: Training probabilistic finite automata with the EM/Baum-Welch algorithm
  is computationally very intensive, especially if random ergodic automata are used
  initially, and additional strategies such as deterministic annealing are used. In
  this paper we present some optimization and parallelization strategies to the Baum-Welch
  algorithm that often allow for training of much larger automata with a larger number
  of observations. The tool, \emphtreba, which implements the optimizations, is available
  open-source and its results were used to participate in the PAutomaC PFA/HMM competition.
