title: Integrating Grammatical Inference into Robotic Planning
abstract: This paper presents a method for the control synthesis of robotic   systems
  in an unknown, dynamic, and adversarial environments. We (1)   incorporate a grammatical
  inference module that identifies the   governing dynamics of the adversarial environment
  and (2) utilize   game theory to compute a motion plan for a system given a task   specification.
  The framework is flexible and modular since different   games can be formulated
  for different system objectives and   different grammatical inference algorithms
  can be utilized depending   on the abstract nature of the dynamic environment.
