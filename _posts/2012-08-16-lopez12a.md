title: Inference of k-Testable Directed Acyclic Graph Languages
abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of graph language learning. We   first
  extend the well-known classes of \emphk-testability and   \emphk-testability in
  the strict sense languages to directed graph   languages. Second, we propose a graph
  automata model for directed   acyclic graph languages. This graph automata model
  is used to   propose a grammatical inference algorithm to learn the class of   directed
  acyclic \emphk-testable in the strict sense graph   languages. The algorithm runs
  in polynomial time and identifies this   class of languages from positive data.
