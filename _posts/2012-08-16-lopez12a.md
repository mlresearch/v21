title: Inference of k-Testable Directed Acyclic Graph Languages
abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of graph language learning. We   first
  extend the well-known classes of \emph{$k$-testability} and \emph{$k$-testability in
  the strict sense} languages to directed graph languages. Second, we propose a graph
  automata model for directed acyclic graph languages. This graph automata model
  is used to propose a grammatical inference algorithm to learn the class of directed
  acyclic $k$-testable in the strict sense graph languages. The algorithm runs
  in polynomial time and identifies this class of languages from positive data.
