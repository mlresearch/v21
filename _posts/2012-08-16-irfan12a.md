title: Improving Model Inference of Black Box Components having Large Input Test Set
abstract: The deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning algorithm \emphL* has been
  extended to learn Mealy machine models which are more succinct for \emphinput/output
  (i/o) based systems.  We propose an optimized learning algorithm \emphL_1 to infer
  Mealy models of software black box components. The \emphL_1 algorithm uses a modified
  observation table and avoids adding unnecessary elements to its columns and rows.  The
  proposed improvements reduce the worst case time complexity. The \emphL_1 algorithm
  is compared with the existing Mealy inference algorithms and the experiments conducted
  on a comprehensive set confirm the gain.
