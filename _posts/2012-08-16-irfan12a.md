title: Improving Model Inference of Black Box Components having Large Input Test Set
abstract: The deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning algorithm \emph{L*} has
  been extended to learn Mealy machine models which are more succinct for \emph{input/output
  (i/o)} based systems.  We propose an optimized learning algorithm \emph{L_{1}} to
  infer Mealy models of software black box components. The \emph{L_{1}} algorithm
  uses a modified observation table and avoids adding unnecessary elements to its
  columns and rows.  The proposed improvements reduce the worst case time complexity.
  The \emph{L_{1}} algorithm is compared with the existing Mealy inference algorithms
  and the experiments conducted on a comprehensive set confirm the gain.
