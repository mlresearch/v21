title: Results of the PAutomaC Probabilistic Automaton Learning Competition
abstract: Approximating distributions over strings is a hard learning problem. Typical
  GI techniques involve using finite state machines as models and attempting to learn
  both the structure and the weights, simultaneously. The PAutomaC competition is
  the first challenge to allow comparison between methods and algorithms and builds
  a first state of the art for these techniques. Both artificial data and real data
  were proposed and contestants were to try to estimate the probabilities of test
  strings. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the implementation
  details of PAutomaC and to report the final results of the competition.
