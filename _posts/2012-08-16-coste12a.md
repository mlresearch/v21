title: Locally Substitutable Languages for Enhanced Inductive Leaps
abstract: Genomic banks are fed continuously by large sets of DNA or RNA sequences
  coming from high throughput machines.  Protein annotation is a task of first importance
  with respect to these banks.  It consists of retrieving the genes that code for
  proteins within the sequences and then predict the function of these new proteins
  in the cell by comparison with known families.  Many methods have been designed
  to characterize protein families and discover new members, mainly based on subsets
  of regular expressions or simple Hidden Markov Models.  We are interested in more
  expressive models that are able to capture the long-range characteristic interactions
  occurring in the spatial structure of the analyzed protein family. Starting from
  the work of Clark and Eyraud (2007) and Yoshinaka (2008) on inference of substitutable
  and \emphk,l-substitutable languages respectively, we introduce new classes of substitutable
  languages using local rather than global substitutability, a reasonable assumption
  with respect to protein structures to enhance inductive leaps performed by least
  generalized generalization approaches. The concepts are illustrated on a first experiment
  using a real proteic sequence set.
