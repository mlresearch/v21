title: Speeding Up Syntactic Learning Using Contextual Information
abstract: It has been shown in (Angluin and Becerra-Bonache, 2010, 2011) that interactions
  between a learner and a teacher can help language learning. In this paper, we make
  use of additional contextual information in a pairwise-based generative approach
  aiming at learning (situation,sentence)-pair-hidden markov models. We show that
  this allows a significant speed-up of the convergence of the syntactic learning.
  We apply our model on a toy natural language task in Spanish dealing with geometric
  objects.
