title: Fuzzy Grammar-based Prediction of Amyloidogenic Regions
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the location of amyloidogenic
  regions in proteins.  The language of protein sequence can be described by using
  a formal system such as fuzzy context-free grammar, and the problem of amyloidogenic
  region recognition can be replaced by fuzzy grammar induction.  The induced fuzzy
  grammar achieved 70.6\% accuracy and 96.7\% specificity on a recently published
  amyloidogenic dataset.  Our results are comparable to other methods dedicated to
  recognize amyloid proteins.
