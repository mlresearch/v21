title: Learning Substitutable Binary Plane Graph Grammars
abstract: 'While some heuristics exist for the learning of graph grammars, few has
  been done on the theoretical side. Due to complexity issues, the class of graphs
  has to be restricted: this paper deals with the subclass of plane graphs, which
  correspond to drawings of planar graphs.  This allows us to introduce a new kind
  of graph grammars, using a face-replacement mechanism. To learn them, we extend
  recent successful techniques developed for string grammars, and based on a property
  on target languages: the substitutability property.  We show how this property can
  be extended to plane graph languages and finally state the first identification
  in the limit result for a class of graph grammars, as far as we know.'
