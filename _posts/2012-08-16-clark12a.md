title: 'Beyond Semilinearity: Distributional Learning of Parallel Multiple Context-free
  Grammars'
abstract: Semilinearity is widely held to be a linguistic invariant but, controversially,
  some linguistic phenomena in languages like Old Georgian and Yoruba seem to violate
  this constraint. In this paper we extend distributional learning to the class of
  parallel multiple context-free grammars, a class which as far as is known includes
  all attested natural languages, even taking an extreme view on these examples.  These
  grammars may have a copying operation that can recursively copy constituents, allowing
  them to generate non-semilinear languages.  We generalise the notion of a context
  to a class of functions that include copying operations.  The congruential approach
  is ineffective at this level of the hierarchy; accordingly we extend this using
  dual approaches, defining nonterminals using sets of these generalised contexts.  As
  a corollary we also extend the multiple context free grammars using the lattice
  based approaches.
